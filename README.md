# 📊 JavaScript Calculator: A Node.js Demo App 💻

## 🎯 Purpose and Goals
The goal of this project is to create a simple calculator demo application using Node.js, demonstrating its capabilities and versatility in building a basic calculator functionality.

## 👥 Target Audience
This project is designed for developers and enthusiasts interested in exploring Node.js and its ecosystem, as well as those looking for a simple calculator application.

## 📝 Description
This is a Node.js demo application designed to showcase the language's capabilities in creating a simple calculator. The application uses JavaScript syntax and leverages npm for package management. It includes a range of features, such as basic arithmetic operations, unit conversion, and memory management. The calculator is also containerized using Docker, making it easy to run and deploy.

## 🏗️ Architecture
The application uses a modular design, with separate files for each feature, and relies on Node.js's built-in modules for arithmetic and conversion operations. The Dockerfile is used to create a containerized environment for the application.

## ✨ Features
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Unit conversion (length, mass, temperature)
- Memory management (store and recall calculations)
- Containerized environment for easy deployment

## 🚀 Installation
To install the project, follow these steps:
```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ docker build -t my-calculator .
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 my-calculator
```
Alternatively, you can use yarn instead of npm.

## 📖 Usage
To use the calculator, simply navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser. You can then enter calculations using the calculator interface. For example:
```
$ npm run start
$ curl http://localhost:8080/calculate?num1=2&op=+&num2=3
```
This will return the result of the calculation (5) in JSON format.

## 🧪 Testing
To run tests, use the following command:
```
$ npm test
```
This will execute the tests in the `test` directory using Jest.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues with the calculator, try checking the following:
* Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
* Make sure you have the correct Docker version installed.
* Check the calculator's configuration files for any errors.
